Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI

However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to

square. Otherwise,

AI technology called machine learning today, is great at helping for

other chores.
It usually uses an approach called neural networks that works
something like a human brain, not a sequence of IF THIS, THEN steps
as in traditional computing.
TYPES AND FUNCTION OF NEURONS:
Neurons are essential for every action that our body and brain carry out.
It is the complexity of neuronal networks that gives us our personalities and
our consciousness.
They make up around 10 percent of the brain; the rest consists of glial cells
and other cells that support and nourish the neurons.
There are around 86 billion neurons in the brain. To reach this huge
target, a developing fetus must create around 250,000 neurons per
minute !
Each neuron is connected to at least 10,000 others – giving well over
1,000 trillion connections (1 quadrillion connections).
They all connect at a junction called a synapse, which can be electrical or a
higher percentage of them are chemical.
How synapses work:
Neurons are connected to each other at a location
called a Synapse, so that they can communicate messages'''
