1.			Amazon	S3
It	is	a	tool	used	for	backing	up	the	internet	and	less	costly	for	storage	options	in
the	category	of	object-storage.	The	central	part	of	this	option	is	that	data	stored
can	be	retrieved	from	virtually	anywhere	they	are	needed.
2.			AWS	Data	Transfer	Products
As	 the	 term	suggests,	 they	 are	 collecting	 data,	 transferring	 data	 products,	 and
migration	 that	 aids	 the	 collection	 of	 data	seamlessly.	They	 can	 also	 allow	 the
monitoring	and	analysis	of	data	in	actual	time.
3.			Amazon	EC2	(Elastic	Compute	Cloud)
It	 provides	a	 resizable	and	 secured	capacity	 for	computing,	 depending	 on	 your
requirements.	 The	 service,	 therefore,	 is	 designed	 to	 enable	 web-scale	 cloud
computing	more	reachable.
4.			Amazon	SNS	(Simple	Notification	Services)
It	 is	 a	 tool	 for	 delivering	 notification	 messages	 to	 a	 significant	 number	 of
subscribers	 via	 SMS	 or	 email.	 Alarms	 can	 be	 sent,	 including	 service
notifications	 and	 other	 messages	 proposed	 to	 call	 attention	 to	 important
information.
5.			Amazon	KMS	(Key	Management	System)
It	is	a	security	instrument	using	256-bit	encryption	for	data.	Also	safeguarding	it
from	cybercrime/attacks	and	hackers.
6.			Amazon	Lambda
It's	 for	 code	 running	 depending	 on	 a	 particular	 event	 and	 manages	 reliant
resources.	 You	 do	 not	 need	 either	 provisioning	servers	 or	 operating,	 and	 how
much	is	 paid	 depending	 on	the	length	 of	time,	it	takes	in	executing	 your	code.
It's	cost-effective,	unlike	services	that	their	charges	are	according	to	hourly	rates.
7.			Route	53
It	is	a	DNS	 service	in	the	cloud	that	 doesn't	 need	 you	to	 keep	a	 separate	DNS
account.	The	aim	is	to	provide	a	cost-effective	and	reliable	method	to	route	users

1.			Simple	to	Begin	With
Getting	on	track	with	EC2	is	quick	and	straightforward.	All	that	is	required	is	to
choose	pre-configured	software	on	Amazon	Machine	Images	(AMIs)	by	visiting
the	 Amazon	 Web	 Services	 marketplace	 and	 begin	 immediately	 with	 Amazon

software.
2.			Web-Scale	Computing	With	Elasticity
Your	app	can	automatically	scale	to-and-fro	because	Amazon	EC2	is	controlled
through	 web	 service	 application	 programming	 interfaces	 (APIs).	 You	 can
commission	 any	 number	 of	 server	 instances	 at	 the	 same	 time	 to	 increase	 or
decrease	capacity	in	a	few	minutes	through	Amazon	EC2,	which,	in	turn,	makes
it	a	good	AWS	service.
3.			Security
Your	computing	resources	are	protected,	and	the	networking	functionality	made
robust	 by	 Amazon	 EC2	 functioning	 with	 Amazon	 Virtual	 Private	 Cloud
(Amazon	VPC).
You	 choose	the	 IP	 variety	 for	the	VPC	through	which	 your	 compute	 cases	 are
positioned.	 You	 identify	 the	 cases	 that	 stay	 private	 and	 those	 visible	 to	 the
internet.
4.			Works	in	Combination	with	Other	AWS	Components
For	 selecting	 applications,	 Amazon	 EC2	 affords	 computing	 solutions,	 query
processing	 and	 provides	storage	 through	 working	 in	 association	 with	 Amazon
Simple	 Queue	 Service,	Amazon	Relational	Database	 Service,	Amazon	 Simple
DB,	and	Amazon	Simple	Storage	Service.
5.			Flexible	Services	for	Cloud	Hosting
There	 are	 several	 software	 development	 packages	 and	 functioning	 system
instance	 forms	 that	 you	 can	 choose	 via	 Amazon	 EC2.	 You	 can	select	 a	 boot
partition	size	appropriate	for	the	functioning	system	and	application	you	have	in

Resource Pooling:
Cloud providers pool their computing resources to serve multiple customers. These resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand, ensuring efficient utilization.
Rapid Elasticity:
Cloud resources can be scaled up or down quickly to accommodate changes in workload or demand. Users can access additional resources during peak periods and release them when no longer needed.
Measured Service:
Cloud usage is metered, and users pay only for the resources they consume. This pay-as-you-go model allows for cost-effective and flexible pricing.'''

Offers a platform that includes infrastructure, development tools, and services required to build, deploy, and manage applications. Developers can focus on writing code without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
Software as a Service (SaaS):
Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access and use these applications through a web browser without the need to install or manage them locally.
