It allows web developers to apply various styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to HTML elements. CSS works in conjunction with HTML to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages.When HTML was first introduced, it primarily focused on structuring the content of a webpage. However, it lacked the capability to control the design and presentation of the content. CSS was introduced to address this limitation. It provides a way to separate the content from the presentation, enhancing the maintainability and flexibility of web pages."

Some commonly used selectors include element selectors (e.g., h1, p, div), class selectors (e.g., .classname), ID selectors (e.g., #idname), and attribute selectors (e.g., [type='text']).CSS properties are the actual styles that you apply to the selected elements. Properties are paired with values to define how an element should look. For example, the color property sets the text color, and the font-size property adjusts the size of the text. CSS properties can be applied directly to HTML elements using inline styles or grouped together in a style block or external CSS file."

Every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box, and the box model consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. The content area is where the actual content of the element is displayed. The padding provides space between the content and the border. The border is a line that surrounds the padding and content, separating them from neighboring elements. The margin is the transparent area outside the border, creating space between elements. Understanding the box model is essential for proper spacing and layout of elements on a webpage."

Elements with display: block take up the entire width of their container and stack vertically. Elements with display: inline only take up as much width as necessary and do not create line breaks. Elements with display: inline-block behave like inline elements but allow setting width and height. display: none hides the element completely. CSS positioning is another crucial aspect of web layout. The position property allows elements to be positioned using values like static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Each positioning value affects how the element interacts with its surrounding elements."
